I'll build you a beautiful Discord-style creator profile system with all the customization options. Let me create a plan:


Analyzed schema and storage
Let me start by reading the current schema and key files:


Show 2 more

Opened client/src/pages/AccountPage.tsx

Decided on schema adjustments (5 seconds)
Now I understand the structure. I'll build a Discord-style profile system. Let me delegate this to a subagent to implement all the features efficiently:


Implementing creator profile customization

Verified Turso schema usage
Let me verify the schema is still using SQLite (for Turso) and check the current state:


Opened shared/schema.ts

Took a screenshot

Reverted schema to SQLite compatibility
The schema was incorrectly changed to PostgreSQL! The project uses Turso which is SQLite-based. I need to fix this immediately - revert the schema back to using SQLite with drizzle-orm/sqlite-core.

Let me fix the schema file to use SQLite (for Turso) instead of PostgreSQL. I'll need to:

Change the imports from pg-core to sqlite-core
Change pgTable to sqliteTable
Change serial to integer with autoIncrement
Keep boolean as integer with mode: "boolean"
I see the schema was incorrectly changed to PostgreSQL. The project uses Turso (SQLite), so I need to fix this immediately:


Show 4 more

Edited shared/schema.ts

Decided on SQLite schema push
Now let me push the schema changes to Turso and restart the workflow:


Show less

Executed cd /home/user/YouRise && npx drizzle-kit push 2>&1

Found the correct project directory

Executed pwd && ls -la

Pushed schema to Turso

Executed npx drizzle-kit push 2>&1

Decided on workflow restart strategy

Restarted Start application

Assessed AccountPage profile section

Add new profile and link fields

Planned link creation enhancements
Let me find the link creation and locked link pages to continue with the remaining tasks:


Executed find . -name 'client/src/pages/*.tsx' -type f -exec stat -c '%Y %n' '{}' ';' | sort -nr | cut -d' ' -f2-
